description: "April 3, 2016. Clear skies and a fair forcast for auroras. Me and my family left at dusk to go see what the skies had for us. unfortunately we drove and drove for nearly two hours northeast, hoping for break in the clouds. unfortunately at the time, the only clouds in the entire sky were the ones blocking where the auroras were supposed to be. Rather than carry on, we rested at Horseshoe Canyon, a park near Drumheller. Alberta. at around midnight the sky had cleared, and it was dark. Really dark. no moonlight at all to reveal the ground. Fortunately I had my SkyRay King, a lithium ion powered flashlight with 6 Cree T6 LED bulbs in it. Very bright. It was with this that I explored the canyon under nothing but stars. The aurora was very faint along the horizon. Fairly reasonable for an average aurora storm at middlish latitudes. Unfortunately the Panasonic GH3 doesn't do well with high ISO & long exposures. Perhaps in the future, I'll be able to save up for a camera better suited for nightscapes. "
